# Telegram Google Sheet Expense Tracker

This code is meant for the google app script. You can access it via Google Sheet > Tools > Script Editor.

You will need to do these to set up your own expense tracker:
1. Create your own bot and get the token API
2. Webappurl link - you will get this when you publish the webapp in Script Editor
3. Link to google sheet that you will be storing your expenses. This is the google sheet you use to get into Script Editor

To initialize, you need to run the function <code>setWebhook</code> via Script Editor and ensure the webhook is set. You can check under View > Logs. Once web hook is set you are ready!

You may use the code and change the call back and mode!
